A simple tool for deleting comment threads on reddit as a moderator.

This tool is mainly aimed at removing large troll threads or brigading/raids
from other parts of reddit or other websites.

--------
Requirements:

python 3
pip install -r requirements.txt

--------
Usage:

First you will need to follow the instructions for 'Script app's:
https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/OAuth2

Then:

./exterminatus.py thread_url [thread_url2] [...]

On first invocation it will prompt you for your username, password, client id,
and client secret. You will receive the latter two items as part of the OAuth2
setup. It will save these credentials in a file called 'config' in the same
directory the program is run from.
